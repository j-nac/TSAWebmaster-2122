        <h1>Boymade</h1>
        <p>With music perfect for rainy days, Cassius Wood has made a name for himself online under the stage name boymade. He's cited fellow bedroom pop artists as his inspiration, and it shows. Soft tunes and quiet guitar riffs make boymade's music a nostalgic homage to those before him, while also putting a new twist on the genre. <span class="collapse" id="more-text-1">His most recent album, Pumpkin Head, embraces the loneliness of seasons turning. Wood has spoken about this loneliness in interviews, saying that "It's always been strange for me, recognizing how the world keeps moving. ...I wanted to make something that would slow you down for a moment and just give listeners a reprieve from how fast it can seem like everything moves." Making his first appearance at ArchFest, Wood is excited for the opportunity to break barriers and show off what he can do in an online format. </span><a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-1">More...</a></p>

        <h1>The Embers</h1>
        <p>The Embers have made it their mission to break out of any boxes they may be put in. Made up of Ainsley Owens, Zoe Carter, and Karissa Porter, this band is making genre-defying music and changing the industry around them. <span class="collapse" id="more-text-2">After their first song was released on a dare and subsequently went viral, The Embers immediately established themselves as a force to be reckoned with. According to the band members themselves, their music is for anyone "angry at the world and looking for something to scream to". At ArchFest they'll be performing songs from their newest album, titled DRAGON. This will be the group's second appearance at the festival, but their first online performance. Their performance at AF22 is going to be the first show in their national Taking Down the Castle tour. </span><a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-2">More...</a></p>

        <h1>Frog Days</h1>
        <p>Duo Frog Days (made of Jasmyn Sanders and Em Sullivan) are starring in their own coming-of-age movie. Ever since the two started making music together as teenagers, they've focused on the change that comes with growing up. Now, with both members in college, the theme of change in Frog Days's music is clearer than ever. <span class="collapse" id="more-text-3">With their new album—titled 2 Frogs on a Lilypad—the two friends have taken the music world by storm. Although it's only their first full album, the duo has already earned critical acclaim for their songwriting and musical talent. But don't think that their newfound fame has changed either member even a little bit. "Honestly, I would rather just keep making music in my bed," Jasmyn has joked. Luckily for them, that wish can come true at ArchFest. This will be their first appearance at the festival, but just one of many online performances. Catch the up-and-coming group if you're in need of relatable lyrics, soft music, or just a good cry. </span><a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-3">More...</a>

        <h1>Bloom</h1>
        <p>Poetic lyrics and a subdued pop sound are what define new group Bloom. Sophina Klein and Lin Matsson are the rising stars behind Bloom's critically praised debut album, Open Doors. <span class="collapse" id="more-text-4">These young artists are bringing new talent into pop; they write, compose, and produce all of their music with no outside influence. Singing about anything from heartbreak to nature, the two have already showcased their songwriting range. And after a solid debut, it seems the only direction Bloom can go is up. ArchFest is honored to be hosting the group's first-ever festival performance (even if the format is a little different than the usual). One thing's for sure: this quickly-growing duo is one to watch. </span><a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-4">More...</a></p>

        <h1>Cam Lane</h1>
        <p>Cameron Lane isn't afraid to pursue their dreams. That's the theme of the artist's new album, Long Way Home. Lane, who goes by Cam, left their native Australia to pursue music in the US; it's a long way home indeed. <span class="collapse" id="more-text-5">But the move has paid off—they're quickly gaining traction across the US (and across the world) due to their comfort living outside of binaries. They continue to break the gender binary in their performances, as well as defying expectations and categories in the music world. Their music is something to dance to, something to cry to, and something to road-trip to all in one. Cam is guaranteed to surprise you and leave you starstruck, so watch them in their first ArchFest appearance for the change of pace you've been needing. </span><a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-5">More...</a></p>

        <h1>Anywhere/Everywhere</h1>
        <p>If you think you know what genre of music the group titled Anywhere/Everywhere makes, group members Malia Donalds and Jaimee Broin have one thing to say to you: no you don't. These two are boldly making music their own way, ignoring the usual conventions entirely. <span class="collapse" id="more-text-6">This includes using some unusual instruments, including cameras, paint, and household objects. They've even managed to combine mediums, and earned online fame after debuting a song made with a painting. Some may write the group off, or even simply call them "crazy", but Donalds and Broin are determined to forge their own path. "We don't even define ourselves," Broin has said. "We just want to make music that nobody has ever made before." Anywhere/Everywhere's performance at ArchFest this year will be their fourth, and a homecoming of sorts after they took a hiatus from performing previous to the pandemic. </span><a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-6">More...</a></p>

        <h1>Evan Walker</h1>
        <p>Evan Walker combines the classical sound of piano with upbeat pop, making music unlike anyone else—and he knows it. Walker refuses to conform to any one genre, continually changing his sound in order to stand out from the rest. <span class="collapse" id="more-text-7">This makes his music perfect for ArchFest, which is unlike any other music festival. The artist's appearance at AF22 will be his first, making the online format all the more exciting. It will also be his first appearance at any major music festival, an honor we at ArchFest are proud to hold. Walker's performance is almost guaranteed to make you think, shed a few tears, and leave you wanting more. His first album, self-titled Walker, will come out just before the festival. </span><a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-7">More...</a></p>

        <h1>Star•strung</h1>
        <p>She might be young, but artist Lindsey Hart has already made a name for herself as Star•strung. Creating music that she wants to listen to, Hart has committed to remaining unsigned and uninfluenced by others' opinions of her. She often switches between slow acoustic odes and fast, angry rock, meaning that there's a song in her discography for any mood. <span class="collapse" id="more-text-8">This will be her second appearance at ArchFest, and we're almost as excited as she is! "I love performing virtually," the artist said recently. "It's just a different kind of challenge, and I love rising to meet that challenge." If anyone will rise to the challenge of a virtual concert, it's Star•strung. In fact, her most recent album sky was recorded entirely virtually during the pandemic. Give Hart the opportunity to blow you away, and she won't disappoint.</span> <a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-8">More...</a></p>

        <h1>Hey, there!</h1>
        <p>Hey, there! No, that's not a greeting; that's the name of a hugely popular anonymous group. Although they've amassed a following of over half a million listeners, none of the members of Hey, there! have ever shown their faces (in fact, we can't even say how many of them there are). <span class="collapse" id="more-text-9">Despite this, their heartfelt and achingly honest music has allowed listeners to connect across the world. Writing about the struggles of youth, conformity, and mental health, the band has made a name for themselves in the world of indie pop. Fortunately, ArchFest's online format lends itself perfectly to a group like this. Their appearance at the festival will be Hey, there!'s first-ever public performance. Those who tune in will enjoy sneak peeks from their upcoming album as well as songs from their latest EP, Go Away. This group is ready to make history, as long as you're ready to listen. </span><a class="more-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-text-9">More...</a></p>
